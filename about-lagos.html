						Profile of Lagos State
					</h5>
					<p>Lagos State was created on May 27, 1967 by virtue of States [Creation and Transitional
						Provisions] Decree No. 14 of 1967 which restructured Nigeria’s Federation into 12 States. Prior
						to this, Lagos Municipality was administered as a Federal Territory by the Federal Government
						through the Federal Ministry of Lagos Affairs as the regional authority, while the Lagos City
						Council governed the City of Lagos. Equally, the Metropolitan areas [Colony Province] of Ikeja,
						Agege, Mushin, Ojo, Ikorodu, Epe, and Badagry were then administered by the Western Region
						Government. The State took off as an administrative entity on April 11, 1968 with Lagos Island
						serving the dual role of being the State and Federal Capital respectively. However, with the
						creation of the Federal Capital Territory of Abuja in 1976, Lagos ceased to be the capital of
						the State, as this was moved to Ikeja. Similarly, with the formal relocation of the seat of the
						Federal Government to Abuja on 12th December, 1991, Lagos ceased to be Nigeria’s political
						capital. Nevertheless, Lagos remains the nation’s economic and commercial capital. According to
						extant political records, “Lagos is to the people of Nigeria, what the head is to the body of an
						individual”.

						The dominant vegetation of the State is the swamp forest of the fresh water and mangrove swamp
						forests, both of which are influenced by the double rainfall pattern of the state, which makes
						the environment a wetland region. Generally, the State has two climatic seasons: Dry
						[November-March] and Wet [April-October]. The drainage system of the State is characterized by a
						maze of lagoons and waterways, which constitutes about 22% or 787 sq. km. [75.755 hectares] of
						the State’s territory. The major water bodies are the Lagos and Lekki Lagoons, Yewa, Ogun,
						Oshun, and Kweme Rivers. Others are Ologe Lagoon, Kuramo Waters, and Badagry, Five Cowries and
						Omu Creeks respectively.

					<p class="my-4">
						Lagos State is the smallest state in Nigeria yet, it has the highest urban population, which is
						27.4 % of the national estimate [UN-Habitat]. According to the 2006 National Census, Lagos State
						has a population of 9,013,534 in relation to the National count of 140,003,542. However, based
						on the UN-Habitat and international development agencies’ estimates, Lagos State is said to have
						about 24.6 million inhabitants in 2015. Of this population, Metropolitan Lagos accounts for over
						85% on an area that is 37% of the land area of the State, and the fact that Lagos population is
						growing 10 times faster than that of New York and Los Angeles, and more than the population of
						32 African nations combined, the State population is expected to hit the 35 million mark in
						2020.

					<h5 class="text-uppercase font-weight-bold">The Lagos Megacity</h5>
					<p class="my-4">
						Lagos, Nigeria’s lagoon city, Africa’s leading NEPAD City and World’s sixth megacity is a
						bourgeoning global urban agglomeration which attained megacity status in 1995 when its
						population soared to over 10 million people, per UN-Habitat. From its global city ranking of
						31st in 1985, Lagos population exploded to 13.4 million in Y2000 to become world’s sixth
						megacity and Africa’s foremost urban centre and hub of national, regional and global
						socio-economic and political activities. The Megacity region, which approximates to 17 of the
						State’s 20 Local Government and 37 Local Council Development Areas and impinges imperceptibly on
						four local government areas of the adjoining Ogun State of Nigeria, is geographically disjointed
						[maze of islands/mainland], located on poor soil [wetlands] and overwhelmed by its growth [6% –
						8% urbanization rate].

					<h5 class="text-uppercase font-weight-bold">People</h5>
					<p class="my-4">
						Lagos State is essentially a Yoruba environment inhabited by its sub-nationality of Aworis and
						Ogus in Ikeja and Badagry Divisions respectively, with the Ogus being found mainly in Badagry
						and the Awori forming the indigenous population of Lagos where there are, nevertheless, other
						pioneer immigrant settlers – Edos, Saros, Brazilians, Kannike/Tapa, etc collectively called
						Lagosians but more appropriately referred to as the Ekos. For Ikorodu and Epe Divisions, the
						local populations are mainly the Remos and Ijebus with pockets of Eko-Awori settlers along the
						entire State coastland and riverine areas. However, despite its Yoruba indigeneity, the State is
						a global socio-cultural melting pot attracting Nigerians, Africans and foreigners alike. The
						situation is attributable to its sound economic base, strategic maritime location and
						socio-political importance which induced a high rate of migration to the State.

					<h5 class="text-uppercase font-weight-bold">administrative Divisions (Ibile)</h5>
					<p class="my-4">
						With a territorial land area of 351,861 hectares, Lagos State is made of five administrative
						divisions, namely: Ikeja, Badagry, Ikorodu, Lagos [Eko] and Epe. The divisions were created in
						May 1968 by virtue of Administrative Divisions [Establishment] Edict No. 3 of April 1968. The
						Divisions are further divided into 20 Local Governments and 37 Local Council Development Areas
						respectively, in accordance with Nigeria’s federal structure and the need to bring governance,
						development and participatory democracy to the grassroots.

							Ikorodu lies approximately 36 km north of Lagos and derives its name from ‘Oko-Odu’ meaning
							vegetable farm. This farmland was the first place where Oga, the crown prince of a Remo King
							and supposed founder of the town settled hence, the reference to the town as Ikorodu Oga.
							The Division consists of Ikorodu Local Govenment, and five Local Council Development Areas
							including: Igbogbo-Baiyeku, Ikorodu North, Ikorodu West, Imota and Ijede. By virtue of its
							location, the Division serves as the gateway to the country’s hinter-land. It is also an
							active commercial/energy center and national broadcasting gangway as the transmitters of the
							Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria [FRCN], Voice of Nigeria [VON] and those of the State
							Broadcasting Corporation, [Radio Lagos/Eko F.M. and LTV], are located there. The population

							as eight Local council development areas which include: Lagos Island East, Yaba,
							Itire-Ikate, Coker-Aguda, Ikoyi-Obalende, Apapa-Iganmu, Eti-Osa East and Iru/Victoria Island
							with the City of Lagos being the pivot of an ever expanding Megacity and the divisional
							headquarters. The center and the most developed of this island chain, Lagos Island, is
							called ‘Eko’ by the indigenes. The name ‘Lagos’ is a derivative of a Portuguese imposition
							of ‘Lagos de Curamo’ or ‘Rio Lago’ on account of its wetland topography and network of
							lagoons. The Island is the cultural watershed of the White Cap [Idejo] Chieftaincy and
							metropolitan Lagos with the Oba of Lagos as the paramount monarch and primus inter pares of
							the State traditional authorities. Lagos is the chief commercial, financial and maritime
							nerve-center of Nigeria with seaports at Apapa, Tin Can Island, Roro Terminal Ports and
							Ijora Container Terminal. It has an ever-expanding Central Business Disrict in Tinubu and
							Victoria Island. As the economic capital and major port of Africa’s most populous nation,
							Lagos has attracted immigrants from all over Nigeria and beyond, as well as commercial
							entrepreneurs and industries from Africa, Europe, Asia and the Americas. Major settlements
							in the Division are: Tarkwa Bay, Victoria Island, Iru, Lagos Island, Ikoyi, Obalende, Oto,

							The Division is made up of two Local Government Councils, namely: Epe, Ibeju-Lekki while the
							three Local Council Development Areas are: Lekki, Ikosi-Ejirin and Eredo with Epe serving as
							the divisional headquarters. It lies about 89kms north-east of the City of Lagos. Urakaloye
							was the man reputed to be the ancestral founder of Epe, a name derived from black ants,
							which invaded Urakaloye’s hunting homestead. Hence, the town’s name, Epe, means the forest
							of black ants. Epe Division consists of Epe, Orugbo-Iddo, Agbowa-Ikosi, Ilara, Odo-Ayandelu,
							Odoragunsin, Igbooye, Naforija, Igbodu, Ejinrin, Poka, Itoikin, Idotun, Ita-Oko, Omi, Temu,

							presence of a long range of hills, which demarcates the coastal town into equal parts.
							However, in Ibeju-Lekki, artisanal fishing, sandy beach and coconut fringed Atlantic
							coastlines are distinctive features of the environment which has enormous tourism
							potentials. Fishing and farming form the major occupations of the inhabitants of the
							Division, which also includes the Eko Aworis.

							[GDP] accounted for 26.7% of Nigeria’s total GDP and more than 50% of non-oil GDP. Over 50%
							of Nigeria’s non-oil industrial capacity is located in Lagos. Lagos is also Nigeria’s
							financial hub with all major banks having their headquarters in the City. It is also home to
							the Nigerian Stock Exchange [NSE]. It accounts for over 80% of the country’s foreign trade
							flows, and generates over 50% of Nigeria’s port revenues. The estimated GDP of Lagos was put
							at N27.125trillion [$145.141billion] in 2016 by the Lagos Bureau of Statistics and is
							expected to rise to N628trillion [$157.728billion] by 2018 with projected average annual
							growth rate of 4.2% up to 2018. Lagos economy, with an estimated population of 24million is
							larger than any other economy in the ECOWAS sub-region despite the rebasing of Ghana’s GDP.
							Fuelled by Public-Private investments, as well as an estimated population of over 24million,

						To enhance effective and efficient implementation of the land policies, and also to ease the way
						of doing business in the State, land administration process has been computerized with the
						introduction of the Electronic Document Management Service [EDMS]. The Land Registry has been
						upgraded and restructured, and its business processes has also been reviewed tremendously. The
						laybout of the Lands Registry has been redesigned to ensure easy flow of processes and
						transactions which in turn leads t faster processing of documents. The work-flow interface with
						customers in all Directorates in Lands Bureau has been collapsed into four occasions: Applicant
						submits application – Applicant collects Demand Notice – Applicant submits revenue receipts –
						Applicant comes back to collect reistered title documents. <br><br> The State has created a new
						land allocation system for schemes such that it ensures easy access to allocated land and prompt
						issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy within 30 days of payment of all land charges. It has
						also embarked on the computerization of all processes with the aim of being fully ICT compliance
